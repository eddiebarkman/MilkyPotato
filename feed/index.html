Not even close! However we are currently testing out what we do have in a few different engines&#8230; We have spent days in different engines trying to learn how they work before starting over in a new one. However I think we are close to choosing the one that will work best for us. The reason we&#8217;ve gone through so many is because we want to find one that doesn&#8217;t have a huge learning curve but also allows us to do a lot of customization in things we want to do. There are a lot of really good 2D engines out there!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s starting to get exciting because we are seeing our ideas begin to take shape and come to life. Our current goal is to get our first few minutes of the game finished so that we can make sure that all of our art and in game functions work correctly. Once we have all the foundation ready we can start building up our assets and eventually start developing the playable game!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holy wow there is a lot to do! However it&#8217;s so much fun seeing stuff start to slowly come together. We have a good amount of artwork done for the characters, thanks to Miru! She is still working hard on the many different characters we have. Meanwhile I&#8217;m still working on sprites. I made a few full sprite sheets for characters however we are thinking of going in a different direction, a possibly more simplistic style. So I might be starting from scratch&#8230;Which is fine, more practice! This is one of our potatoes. Isn&#8217;t he cute? <img class="alignnone wp-image-19" src="http://i0.wp.com/milkypotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/potatoSprite2.gif?resize=84%2C84" alt="potatoSprite2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also working on some music! Which is a lot of fun! Maybe I&#8217;ll post a link to one of the songs on this post once I figure out a good place to upload it.</p>
<p>I started playing the violin when I was in 4th Grade. I wasn&#8217;t very good but I had fun. I also started learning piano and guitar for a few years in college. I&#8217;ve written a few simple songs in the past on piano. Nothing extremely complicated or detailed. Just things I found pleasant to hear and play. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to bring to whatever music I end up creating for our game.</p>
<p>So much to do!!!</p>

<p>Meanwhile I&#8217;ve been learning how to create pixel art. We&#8217;ve definitely decided that we want our game to have a retro JRPG feel to it. Influenced by the Tales series and other games!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m learning that there is a lot of work that goes into sprites. Especially if you<img class="wp-image-62 alignright" src="http://i2.wp.com/milkypotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinaoSprite.gif?resize=151%2C151" alt="kinaosprite" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/milkypotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinaoSprite.gif?resize=300%2C300 300w, http://i1.wp.com/milkypotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinaoSprite.gif?resize=150%2C150 150w, http://i0.wp.com/milkypotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinaoSprite.gif?resize=180%2C180 180w, http://i2.wp.com/milkypotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinaoSprite.gif?resize=350%2C350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 151px) 100vw, 151px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> want them to move smoothly. We are testing out different styles for now.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a random version of what I&#8217;m working on&#8230; Assuming the gif works. Definitely not final art, I&#8217;m still learning!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, I&#8217;m not a writer&#8230; So please forgive my bad grammatical skills. This is mainly to keep updates on the progress on our game and our developer lives! First of all we are a team of two! Yes just two. We&#8217;ve both just recently graduated from our universities and have decided to try and build a game together. Impossible? NO WAY. Hard? YES&#8230; A ton of work that will most likely consume months(years even) of our lives? Most likely. And by most likely I mean it is definitely going to be a huge amount of work for the two of us. But we are going to give it a shot because we have DETERMINATION. Most days.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start with a small update on what&#8217;s been going on. We&#8217;ve been tossing around storyline ideas and character backgrounds. We want the game to be mainly story driven more than anything else. So currently we are getting our ideas organized and trying to tie up loose story-lines together. Once we have that done we will start on other things like how we want the story to progress in the game.</p>
<p>Wish us luck as we jump into this field with bright eyes and full of hope!</p>
